Implement a class Car with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel efficiency (measured in miles/gallon) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank. The efficiency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel level is 0. Supply a method drive that simulates driving the car for a cartain distance, reducing the fuel level in the gas tank, and methods getGasLevel, to return the current fuel level and addGas, to tank up. Sample usage:

Car myHybrid = new Car(50); //50 miles per gallon

myHybrid.addGas(20); // Tank 20 gallons

myHybrid.drive(100); // Drive 100 miles

System.out.println(myHybrid>.getGasLevel()); // Print fuel remaining.
